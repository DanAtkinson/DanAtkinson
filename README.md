Hello! :wave:

# About

My name is Dan Atkinson, I live in Yorkshire, UK with my wife and son. I'm a software engineer and have been working as a full-stack developer since about 2006 following studying in [University of Lincoln](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5fzmmrk6kk). The majority of my work involves working in [.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework) (Framework and Core), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular), [AngularJs](https://github.com/angular/angularjs), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/bootstrap), and a bit of scripting (almost entirely [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)).

# Information and disclaimer

If you wish to connect with me on LinkedIn but we have not previously worked together, please send me an introductory message **first**!

**NB: I am not currently looking for further employment. Please do not contact me with job offers or employment-related interview requests. Thank you.**

**NNB:** my Twitter feed is a reflection of my __own personal thoughts and feelings__. They __do not__ reflect those of my employers or any organisations that I work with. That being said, I'm anti-racist, anti-facist, and enjoy discussion around [green energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy), [infosec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security), the future of education, and seemingly _most_ of the things [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) is involved with.
