# About

Hello! :wave: My name is Dan Atkinson, I live in Yorkshire, UK with my wife and son. I'm a software engineer and have been working as a full-stack developer since about 2006 following studying in [University of Lincoln](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5fzmmrk6kk "Neither a Rick-roll, nor the hilarious scene from The Inbetweeners about the University of Lincoln!"). The vast majority of my work involves [.NET](https://github.com/microsoft/dotnet ".NET on Github") (both Framework and Core), [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular "Angular on Github"), [AngularJS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js "AngularJS on Github"), [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery "jQuery on Github"), [Bootstrap](https://github.com/bootstrap "Bootstrap on Github"), and [PowerShell](https://github.com/powershell/powershell "Powershell (Core) on Github").
